        desc: '"The SoundCloud You Loved Is Doomed" encapsulates a growing worry among users and the artistic community that the essence of what made SoundCloud unique and beloved is at risk. Historically cherished for its user-centric model, which empowered artists to share and connect with a global audience in an accessible and collaborative environment, recent developments seem to signify a departure from these fundamental principles.One of the primary concerns centers around a potential shift towards a more commercialized approach. This shift could manifest through increased emphasis on advertisements, premium subscriptions, or alterations in the revenue-sharing model, which may compromise the platforms original ethos of providing a free and open space for both artists and listeners.Furthermore, changes in copyright policies and licensing agreements have emerged as a significant worry. Such alterations might result in restrictions on the availability of certain tracks or modifications to how music is shared and discovered, impacting the diversity and breadth of content that initially made SoundCloud appealing.Alterations in the platforms algorithms for music discovery and recommendations are also feared. These changes might inadvertently favor mainstream or established artists over emerging and independent ones, hindering the discovery of new and unique sounds—a key feature that endeared SoundCloud to its users.'

        desc: "For his 2017 feature debut, Brit director Daniel Kokotajlo delved into his own personal experiences growing up as a member of the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Apostasy, a remarkable drama that opened a window into the strict Christian sect he had long since turned his back on, was celebrated as one of the most daring and powerful U.K. films of the year, landing a BAFTA nomination and five British Independent Film Award nominations.        For his follow up, Kokotajlo has headed into a distinctly more creepy and chilling direction. Starve Acre, which has its world premiere at the BFI London Film Festival on Oct. 12, is a gothic, folksy horror led by Brit stars Morfydd Clark, already a genre hero thanks to her breakout Saint Maud, and, in role like little he’s done before, Matt Smith. Based on the book by Andrew Michael Hurley and largely set in a remote farmhouse in 1970s England, the story follows a couple whose otherwise idyllic rural life is thrown into turmoil when their 5-year-old son starts acting out of character, a situation that brings the fore a folkloric myth concerning the land around their home, into which they unwittingly welcome sinister, supernatural forces."

        desc: `One of the greatest films of Indian cinema, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, was released on October 16, 1998. Hence, this year, the love saga will complete 25 years. As expected, the excitement is palpable and Dharma Productions, the producers, have decided to celebrate the anniversary in a grand fashion. A few hours ago, the social media handle of the production house, announced that a special screening of the film will be held on Sunday, October 15. The booking was soon opened and in no time, the shows got sold out.
        An exhibition source told Bollywood Hungama, “The low price point must have played a part. It’s unbelievable for moviegoers that they will get to see the film in a swanky multiplex for just Rs. 25. Moreover, the film has a charm and is timeless. Many moviegoers were too young or were not even born when it was released in 1998. Hence, they either don’t vividly remember or have never seen the film on the big screen. And of course, Shah Rukh Khan’s presence in the lead along with Kajol and Rani Mukerji and association of Karan Johar as the director, all of whom are going strong even today, also must have been another reason why the shows got house full immediately.”
        The source continued, “Nevertheless, no one expected such reception to the re-release of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. There was no prior intimation. The booking began all of a sudden and yet, such was the response.”
        As per another source, one more show of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai will be added in the same theatre, that is, PVR Icon Versova. It now remains to be seen if more shows of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai are added not just in other PVR theatres Mumbai but also in other cities. `

        desc: `Eddie Murphy is facing off with angry geese — enchanted ceramic Christmas villagers and one havoc — wreaking elf in the first trailer for Candy Cane Lane.
        Prime Video released the teaser for Eddie Murphy’s first holiday film on Thursday — offering a fuller look at the adventure comedy where Christmas wishes go awry. The film reunites the actor and comedian with director Reginald Hudlin and producer Brian Grazer for the first time since 1992’s Boomerang. 
        Murphy stars as Chris Carver, a man on a mission to win his annual Christmas home decoration contest — a desire not shared by his rather exasperated family. But when he and his youngest daughter stumble upon a Christmas store, his dream of “the best Christmas ever” — winning the contest — becomes a nightmare after an elf named Pepper (Jillian Bell) grants his wish, literally.`

        desc: `The show “follows nine pairs of everyday people as they are unleashed on an epic global adventure through a series of Bond-inspired challenges for a shot at each winning a life-changing £1,000,000 ($1.2 million) prize,” and promises that the challenges will “push their physical strength and mental reserves to the limit.”Cox plays “The Controller,” the “mastermind behind the game, who dictates where the pairs go, what they must do, and sets their questions. He monitors each pair’s quest, delighting in the unfolding drama of his intricately devised and often relentless challenges.”The teaser trailer shows off some of the global locations in the series, such as the Scottish Highlands, Chile’s Atacama Desert, the streets of Venice and the Swiss Alps.
        The series is produced by the team behind the Bond film franchise, including Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson.
        In 2021, Amazon acquired Bond rights holder MGM for $8.45 billion, and questions have circled about how Amazon might handle the iconic franchise. The release comes as producers are seeking a new actor to replace Daniel Craig for the next Bond film and beyond.`

Even if talks resume and a settlement were to happen soon, however, it would likely be early 2024 before the two dozen or so dramas and comedies that normally premiere in the fall make it back onto screens.
        As luck would have it, though, the era of peak streaming provides a nearly limitless array of series to watch. Below are a handful of new or recent lesser-known shows, many of them from outside the United States, on smaller streaming platforms (and one over-the-air network) that can help viewers fill in gaps in their viewing schedules while waiting for homegrown favorites to return. One bonus: None of the shows below are produced by companies against whom Hollywood’s unions are or were striking this year. Unless noted, all the streamers below offer seven-day free trials before subscription charges begin.`

        “There is a real mystery happening on the Old Navy set, which is the case of the disappearing denim jeans,” Lyonne tells The Hollywood Reporter. “I wore them with that overcoat and the beanie. Those jeans are so cute and I’m obsessed with them. And when we wrapped, we went to find them to take home. And it’s been the real magical mystery tour of the holiday campaign shoot. We were looking in every room … we’re hoping to crack it by the Emmys, Cristina [Ehrlich] and I. Then if not, we’re gonna send a really, excited request to Old Navy for a new pair of jeans.”`
