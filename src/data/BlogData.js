        desc: '"The SoundCloud You Loved Is Doomed" encapsulates a growing worry among users and the artistic community that the essence of what made SoundCloud unique and beloved is at risk. Historically cherished for its user-centric model, which empowered artists to share and connect with a global audience in an accessible and collaborative environment, recent developments seem to signify a departure from these fundamental principles.One of the primary concerns centers around a potential shift towards a more commercialized approach. This shift could manifest through increased emphasis on advertisements, premium subscriptions, or alterations in the revenue-sharing model, which may compromise the platforms original ethos of providing a free and open space for both artists and listeners.Furthermore, changes in copyright policies and licensing agreements have emerged as a significant worry. Such alterations might result in restrictions on the availability of certain tracks or modifications to how music is shared and discovered, impacting the diversity and breadth of content that initially made SoundCloud appealing.Alterations in the platforms algorithms for music discovery and recommendations are also feared. These changes might inadvertently favor mainstream or established artists over emerging and independent ones, hindering the discovery of new and unique sounds—a key feature that endeared SoundCloud to its users.'

        desc: "For his 2017 feature debut, Brit director Daniel Kokotajlo delved into his own personal experiences growing up as a member of the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Apostasy, a remarkable drama that opened a window into the strict Christian sect he had long since turned his back on, was celebrated as one of the most daring and powerful U.K. films of the year, landing a BAFTA nomination and five British Independent Film Award nominations.        For his follow up, Kokotajlo has headed into a distinctly more creepy and chilling direction. Starve Acre, which has its world premiere at the BFI London Film Festival on Oct. 12, is a gothic, folksy horror led by Brit stars Morfydd Clark, already a genre hero thanks to her breakout Saint Maud, and, in role like little he’s done before, Matt Smith. Based on the book by Andrew Michael Hurley and largely set in a remote farmhouse in 1970s England, the story follows a couple whose otherwise idyllic rural life is thrown into turmoil when their 5-year-old son starts acting out of character, a situation that brings the fore a folkloric myth concerning the land around their home, into which they unwittingly welcome sinister, supernatural forces."

        desc: `One of the greatest films of Indian cinema, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, was released on October 16, 1998. Hence, this year, the love saga will complete 25 years. As expected, the excitement is palpable and Dharma Productions, the producers, have decided to celebrate the anniversary in a grand fashion. A few hours ago, the social media handle of the production house, announced that a special screening of the film will be held on Sunday, October 15. The booking was soon opened and in no time, the shows got sold out.
        An exhibition source told Bollywood Hungama, “The low price point must have played a part. It’s unbelievable for moviegoers that they will get to see the film in a swanky multiplex for just Rs. 25. Moreover, the film has a charm and is timeless. Many moviegoers were too young or were not even born when it was released in 1998. Hence, they either don’t vividly remember or have never seen the film on the big screen. And of course, Shah Rukh Khan’s presence in the lead along with Kajol and Rani Mukerji and association of Karan Johar as the director, all of whom are going strong even today, also must have been another reason why the shows got house full immediately.”
        The source continued, “Nevertheless, no one expected such reception to the re-release of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. There was no prior intimation. The booking began all of a sudden and yet, such was the response.”
        As per another source, one more show of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai will be added in the same theatre, that is, PVR Icon Versova. It now remains to be seen if more shows of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai are added not just in other PVR theatres Mumbai but also in other cities. `

The film reunites the actor and comedian with director Reginald Hudlin and producer Brian Grazer for the first time since 1992’s Boomerang. 
        Murphy stars as Chris Carver, a man on a mission to win his annual Christmas home decoration contest — a desire not shared by his rather exasperated family. But when he and his youngest daughter stumble upon a Christmas store, his dream of “the best Christmas ever” — winning the contest — becomes a nightmare after an elf named Pepper (Jillian Bell) grants his wish, literally.`

He monitors each pair’s quest, delighting in the unfolding drama of his intricately devised and often relentless challenges.”The teaser trailer shows off some of the global locations in the series, such as the Scottish Highlands, Chile’s Atacama Desert, the streets of Venice and the Swiss Alps.

A report from 9to5Mac claims that the company will unveil its latest set of iPad lineup, which is slated to take place on October 17. The cited source says the news has been confirmed by multiple sources. Here are the details.If the leak is to be believed, the forthcoming announcement is set to focus primarily on the iPad Air, iPad mini, and the base model iPad. Apple might just make cosmetic changes to the design and the new iPads are said to get upgrades in terms of hardware. So, one can expect to get performance improvements.
        The existing iPad Air, which was launched nearly three years ago, is currently powered by the formidable M1 chip. Apple's next move is expected to involve upgrading this model to the M2 chip, promising a notable boost in performance and efficiency.
        The iPad mini, on the other hand, is set to receive an upgrade to the A16 Bionic chip, a subtle yet significant enhancement over its current A15 Bionic chip. This upgrade aims to address the "jelly scrolling" issue that has plagued some users of the current iPad mini, promising a smoother and more responsive scrolling experience.`,

Apple CEO Tim Cook, in an interview with Brut, was asked the reason behind this. Responding to the question, he said, “I think having an iPhone every year for those people that want it is a great thing."

        desc: `Qualcomm is all set to cut hundreds of jobs. The company has confirmed that the layoffs will take place in December this year. In its recent filings with the California Employment Development Department, Qualcomm asserted that around 1,064 San Diego-based employees and 194 Santa Clara-based employees will be affected by the layoffs. This is about 2.5 percent of their total employee count.A report from CNBC revealed that Qualcomm will start layoffs on December 13 in both locations. Crucially, Qualcomm emphasized that there would be no facility closures at either of these locations, reassuring the local communities.
        In response to inquiries about this move, Qualcomm referred to its last quarterly earnings report, where it had foreseen workforce reductions and restructuring charges. The company stated, "Given the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic and demand environment, we expect to take additional restructuring actions to enable continued investments in key growth and diversification opportunities."`,

        desc: `Meta's text-based social media platform, Threads, was high on the buzzword before its launch in July this year. Users were quite excited for Meta's new platform and it launched at a time when Twitter (now called X) had started charging people for features that were earlier available for free. Hence, Threads was perceived to be Meta's Twitter alternative. The app got millions of downloads within 5 days of its launch and allowed people to seamlessly create a Threads account if they were already using Instagram. It was also reported that Threads might replace X altogether. However, Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri had said in an interaction that the idea behind Threads was not to replace Twitter, but to give users a 'less angry' platform.However now, Threads doesn't appear to be as popular as it had been at the time of its launch. And Meta is seemingly working towards a fix by launching new features for its micro-blogging platform. Yet another feature, similar to Elon Musk's X, will be coming to Threads shortly. And it will be super useful for people.`,

        desc: `You know that wild hunger that threatens to have you falling flat on your face while you’re working out? That is precisely the reason why pre-workout snacks are important.
        Ekta Singhwal, dietician at Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, explained that these snacks play a crucial role in enhancing performance and promoting overall well-being while you’re exercising.
        Your body needs a readily available source of energy when you work out and healthy snacking provides this energy in the form of carbohydrates. For those who don’t know, carbohydrates are the body’s preferred fuel source during moderate to high-intensity activities, like a workout.
        The dizziness you feel during your workout sometimes happens when your blood sugar levels drop too low. Pre-workout snacks can also help stabilise blood sugar levels, important for maintaining energy and preventing fatigue during your workout.`,

        desc: `A new study described the understanding of atrial fibrillation seen in stroke patients. According to the study, atrial fibrillation discovered after a stroke is not the same as irregular heartbeats known prior to the stroke.Millions of stroke survivors worldwide are subjected to extended cardiac monitoring, which leads to the identification of atrial fibrillation, or abnormal heartbeats, in up to 1.5 million of these patients each year.The study, led by Western University professor Dr. Luciano Sposato, proposes that atrial fibrillation detected post-stroke exhibits distinct characteristics. It has a lower prevalence of risk factors, cardiovascular comorbidities, and changes associated with upper chambers of the heart than atrial fibrillation known prior to the stroke. This could potentially explain its association with a decreased risk of another ischaemic stroke, which results from a blocked artery.`,

This can be triggered by factors like a high-sugar diet, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, and even genetics. It's a silent condition that can progress if left unchecked," writes Nutritionist Bhakti Arora Kapoor in her recent Instagram post.Dietary adjustments: Opt for a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit sugar, processed foods, and saturated fats`,
